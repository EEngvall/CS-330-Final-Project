Approach

  My approach to this project was unlike many that I’ve worked on before.  I utilized many new design skills when trying to structure everything in a 3D environment and recreate the image from a 2D representation. I wouldn’t say that I followed any particular design  process, as this is not something I regularly attempt.  I’m not someone that is very creative when it comes to something like this where you have to focus on the colors and textures of an object as much as the functionality of that object.  I think going forward this would be something that I could not only work on to improve but also utilize in future projects that require creating 3D objects. 
	I think the things I learned in regards to programming were the need to structure code into more classes instead of the ever expanding main method.  I think breaking large things into many smaller things will help to not only create cleaner more readable code but also allow myself to refactor it in the future without needing to completely dissect everything and start from scratch. The process of creating smaller incremental iterations that each build into the final project was definitely nice and allowed me to hone specific skills before being asked to complete the entire project.  Using this approach in the future will be very beneficial. 
	As much as I love video games, which use a number of 3D computational graphics, I can definitely see why some of them take a long time to make considering the amount of work that goes into creating these objects from scratch.  Going forward I would say that visualizations such as this can be applied in several pathways, such as advertising and marketing, as well as video games and CGI for films. As far as my personal professional pathway I would love to create video games, but I feel that I would steer more toward the functional aspects more than the graphical aspects.
